   - Add a New Feature to Bus Shuttle Project

  **Assignment tasks:**

  - Fork the repository: https://github.com/hergin/CS690-BusShuttleProject
  -  This will create a copy of the project in your profile and the url will be something like this: https://github.com/[YOUR_GITHUB_NAME]/CS690-BusShuttleProject
  -  Open your fork in Codespaces to work on it
  -  Add a new feature to the project that is described in https://github.com/hergin/CS690-BusShuttleProject/issues/10
         
   **Rubric items**

        1. Run the project through command line
        2. Add a new driver to the system through manager dashboard (new driver name will be your name)
        3. Drive as this new driver (select driver dashboard and select the new driver you have added)
        4. Add a few entries (which means select stops and enter passenger counts)
        5. Stop the program
        6. Show passenger-data.txt file contents to prove that your new driver is there in the records (you can only see this if you added entries as this driver)
        7. Run the project through command line again
        8. Remove the new driver from the system
        9. Go to Driver dashboard and show that the new driver is gone (which means you don't see it in the list)
